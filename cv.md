## About Me

I admire the ability of living organisms to adapt and evolve. As soon as I realized that I had realized myself as a specialist, and in my professional sphere the pace of my development began to slow down, and new, unexplored aspects became less and less, I began to look in which direction to move on. It was a simple choice because: 
- such an interesting, versatile and creative field
- with an open community 
- free access for all
- reasonable training time 

In my opinion, the IT sphere corresponds perfectly. That's why I'm here!

My strengths:
*learning ability
*persistence
*empathy

## Skills

- HTML (Semantic, Accessibility)
- CSS (BEM, Responsive Web Design, CSS Flexbox, Bootstrap grid, etc)
- JavaScript (Basic)
- Git/GitHub

## Code Example

}
console.log(exampleReverse)
```
